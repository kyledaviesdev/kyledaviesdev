### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Software Engineering Major** with a knack for technical troubleshooting. My journey in tech began in high school I had learned how to make a fake Internet Explorer shortcut that actually turned off your computer. I love to build, learn, and contribute to the open-source community.

Beyond coding, you can find me going on walks, playing games, and reading fantasy/sci-fi books.

### 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning/Working On

* **[Storymasters](https://kyledaviesdev.github.io/Storymasters/):** A webpage for storytellers or Dungeon Masters for Dungeons and Dragons. Provides a resource to track characters or generate different ideas for characters or story beats.
* **Learning App Creation:** By using Java and Kotlin, I have made some basic applications, but would like to learn to apply that to an APK.
* **Learning Database UI:** I have a good understanding of the back-end of databases using Microsoft SQL Server but would like to learn more front-end knowledge and make a UI for a database backend keeping track of data.
