### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Software Engineering Major** with a knack for technical troubleshooting. My journey in tech began in high school I had learned how to make a fake Internet Explorer shortcut that actually turned off your computer. I love to build, learn, and contribute to the open-source community.

Beyond coding, you can find me going on walks, playing games, and reading fantasy/sci-fi books.
